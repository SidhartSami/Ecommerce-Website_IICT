# Ozone – Men's Fashion E-Commerce Website 👔🧥👟

**Ozone** is a static e-commerce website developed as part of my first-semester IICT project at FAST NUCES. Inspired by Zara, this project showcases a premium men’s fashion brand with a minimal, modern interface. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and basic **JavaScript**, it demonstrates core front-end skills and website structuring.
